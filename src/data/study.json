    "details": "This project develops a machine learning model to predict pregnancy success rates in infertility patients. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.7347 by building separate prediction models for IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) and DI (Donor Insemination) treatments.\n\nKey Features:\n- Separate optimized models for IVF and DI treatments\n- Utilizes patient characteristics like age, medical history\n- Analyzes treatment-specific data (eggs/embryos for IVF)\n- Considers multiple factors including ovulation info and infertility causes\n- Ensemble techniques for improved accuracy\n\nThe project demonstrates practical application of machine learning in healthcare, specifically in reproductive medicine. The codebase features comprehensive data preprocessing, model optimization, and evaluation metrics.",
