I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where I can tackle complex challenges, whether it's optimizing a language model for a specific domain or architecting a real-time web service. \n\nAlways eager to learn, I view every project as an opportunity to expand my technical horizons and deliver meaningful impact."
